## COMMAND LINE FLASH CARDS

- This was ACTUALLY really fun to make. No sarcasm just simplicity 

## PREREQUISITES

- Python

- SQL

- Peewee

## ABOUT

- The goal was to build a CLI game in Python that was utilizing a database. I choose to do a simple flash card with a front and a back. I also chose some of the hardest questions on Oakland Athletics baseball because I am a die hard fan.

## PLAYING THE GAME

- Once you clone, you may have to install Python3, Peewee and or Postgres if you do not already have it. If you do, it should run smmoothly

- Once setup is complete open the terminal and run questions.py

## ROAPMAP

- I would like to make some of these flash cards multiple choice or true and false.
